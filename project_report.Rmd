## Motivation 
Recent events in American politics - a surging pro-life movement, an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, and pending litigation against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will potentially restrict access to reproductive services & resources for women across the country.

We seek to highlight the importance of such services by demonstrating how increased access to reproductive services lowers rates of STDs/STIs and maternal mortality in New York City, and how these health outcomes vary by socioeconomic factors like income and race.


## Questions
- How does access to reproductive services impact maternal mortality rates and levels of STIs? 
- Insurance
- How do socioeconomic factors of health like income and race affect the relationship between access to services and health outcomes? 


## Epidemiology 
The following are our directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to visually represent the causal assumptions of our project and help identify the presence of confounding for our questions.
