## Introduction
Severe maternal morbidity(SMM) includes health outcomes during labor and delivery that may result in both short-term and/or long term health consequences for women. New York Cityâ€™s rate of SMM increased 28.2 % from 2008 to 2012. Some of the factors contributing to high rates of SMM in New York City may include access to reproductive health services, rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), neighborhood poverty level and race. We will examine the factors that may contribute to the high SMM rates in New York City. 


## Data
The primary dataset we used is the NYC Neighborhood Health Atlas[https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-nynta.page] 
This dataset contains data on 100 health measures and social factors for 188 neighborhoods in New York City. 
We will also be using the Neighborhood Tabulation Areas(NTAs) shapefile.
