## Motivation 
Recent events in American politics - a surging pro-life movement, an increasingly conservative Supreme Court, and pending litigation against the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will potentially restrict access to reproductive services & resources for women across the country.

We seek to highlight the importance of such services by demonstrating how increased access to reproductive services lowers rates of STIs and maternal morbidity in New York City, and how these health outcomes vary by socioeconomic factors such as income and race. Specifically, we will be examining the outcomes of maternal morbidity, preterm births, and gonorrhea in our assessment of maternal and reproductive health.

## Data
The primary dataset we will use is the [NYC Neighborhood Health Atlas](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/neighborhood-health/nyc-neighborhood-health-atlas.page). This dataset contains data on 100 health measures and social factors for 188 neighborhoods in New York City, generated from the 2010 US Census data. 
We will also be using the [Neighborhood Tabulation Areas(NTAs) shapefile](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-nynta.page) to create NYC maps depicting our variables of interest.

## Findings 
In the exploratory analysis section, you can see how access to reproductive services, health insurance coverage, and socioeconomic factors affect our outcomes of interest: severe maternal morbidity, preterm births, gonorrhea.

In the NYC maps section, you will find an interactive, geospatial QGIS map demonstrating the distributions of our outcomes of interest across NYC. Additionally, we dived deeper into visualizing how clustering by poverty or race affects severe maternal morbidity. 

In the regression analysis section, we built a biostatistical models analyzing the significance of the relationships between our outcomes of interest and potential predictors. These models include linear, Poisson regression, and negative binomial regression.
