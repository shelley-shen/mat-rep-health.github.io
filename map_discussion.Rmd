## The Clustering of Severe Maternal Morbidity(SMM) and Key Predictors



### SMM and Poverty

This visualization shows the percent of population living in poverty with clusters of Severe Maternal Morbidity(SMM) overlaid in New York City by Neighborhood Tabulation Areas. Local Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) clusters shows us the categorization of all significant spatial clusters. The "high" cluster areas represent portions of the city that have statistically significant clusters of high SMM rates and the "low" cluster areas represent portions of the city that have statistically significant clusters of low SMM rates. Here, we can see a relationship between the high cluster areas and poverty, particularly in East New York and the Bronx. We also see a relationship between the low poverty areas and low clusters of SMM, particularly in Staten Island and parts of Lower Manhattan.
