## Tidying data

The following steps were taken to clean the NYC NTA data: 

  * Clean names to improve readability
  * Select relevant predictors & outcomes (demographics, SES, health outcomes, insurance status, number of providers)
  * Drop neighborhoods that have no residential population (i.e. LaGuardia airport)
  * Drop observation representing NYC aggregated
  * Remove variables corresponding to 95% CI and reliability metrics of measurements
  * Create new variable clinics_and_chc_count representing aggregated clinic and community health centers to reduce multicollinearity between predictors
  * Create new variables adjusting number of healthcare providers by population in each neighborhood
      + clinics_and_chc_density: clinic & community health centers per 10,000 people
      + non_pcmd_density:  on-primary care providers (specialists like ob-gyns) per 10,000 people
